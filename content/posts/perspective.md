I've been starting to explore in more detail how to use Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.  I've been writing applications for 20 year, building client-server, web and mobile appliations.  I've built my engineering experience in a variety of different industries.  On the one hand I find the linear algebra and statistics knowledge necessary a little overwhelming.  On the other hand the problems of AI and ML systems have their roots in Software Engineering.  There are novel problems that need to be tackled, to be sure, but I think there are a number of problems that can be tackled by applying the principals of Software Engineering to ML practices.

My goal for the is space is to discuss what I learn and what I am practicing to start forming a set of opinions on the state of the art and figuring out how to extend it.  It is a journal of what I've found and what I find interesting.  I hope you enjoy the journey as much as I do.
